- Bloom Filters:
	- It is a data structure designed to tell you, rapidly and memory-efficiently, whether an element is present in a set.

	- The price paid for this efficiency is that it is a probabilistic data structure: either the element is DEFINITELY not in the set or it MAYBE in the set. 

- Fibonacci Heaps:
	- This data structure is an improvisation of binomial heaps by efficiently implementing the "decrease_key" and "delete" function in ammortised O(1) time.
